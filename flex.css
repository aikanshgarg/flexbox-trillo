/**********************************************

- Why SVGs over icon-fonts?
	- screen readers for blind people fail
	- hack to display icons
	- browsers fail more often
	- spritesheet is useful as we need only 1 http request instead of as many as icons

- New CSS properties: 
	currentColor
	Variables 
	::before element for animation
	:not(:last-child)
